# Laya (लय)

Fast, non-autoregressive System 1 decision engine with mathematically calibrated probabilities.

Laya lets you evaluate typed questions (`choice`, `score`, `noul`) over any state (text, email, ticket, or JSON document) in **a single forward pass (~33–38 ms on GPU)**. It produces structured decision outputs and calibrated confidence scores without text generation, token streaming, or hallucinations.

Compatible with [RL Agent models on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/convaiinnovations/rl-agent).

## Installation

```bash
pip install laya
```

---

## Quickstart

```python
import laya

# 1. Load the model from Hugging Face Hub (auto-downloads weights)
agent = laya.load("convaiinnovations/rl-agent")

# 2. Provide any state (string or dictionary)
state = {
    "from": "user@acme.com",
    "subject": "Duplicate charge on invoice #4411",
    "body": "Hi, we were billed twice for March. Please refund the duplicate today or we will cancel our plan."
}

# 3. Define your typed questions
questions = {
    # choice: categorical selection with probabilities & confidence
    "department": {
        "type": "choice",
        "instructions": "Which department should handle this email?",
        "criteria": {
            "billing": "invoices, payments, refunds",
            "technical": "bugs, outages, system errors",
            "sales": "pricing, new contracts",
            "other": "everything else"
        }
    },
    # score: placement on an ordinal rubric
    "urgency": {
        "type": "score",
        "instructions": "How urgent is this request?",
        "criteria": ["not urgent", "soon", "critical deadline or blocking issue"]
    },
    # noul: calibrated boolean probability P(true)
    "churn_risk": {
        "type": "noul",
        "instructions": "Does the user threaten to cancel or leave?"
    },
    "is_phishing": {
        "type": "noul",
        "instructions": "Is this email a phishing or scam attempt?"
    }
}

# 4. Run all questions in ONE single forward pass (~35 ms on GPU)
result = agent.predict(state, questions)
answers = result["answers"]

print("Department :", answers["department"]["choice"])
# -> billing (confidence: 0.94)

print("Urgency    :", answers["urgency"]["score"])
# -> 1.84 / 2.0

print("Churn Risk :", answers["churn_risk"]["noul"])
# -> 0.892 (89.2% probability)

print("Phishing   :", answers["is_phishing"]["noul"])
# -> 0.008 (0.8% probability)
```

## Automated Confidence Gating

Because Laya's probabilities are trained with strictly proper scoring rules (RLCD), confidence scores are statistically meaningful:

```python
dept = answers["department"]["choice"]
conf = answers["department"]["confidence"]

if conf >= 0.85:
    # High confidence: automated action without human in the loop
    route_automatically(dept)
else:
    # Low confidence: escalate to human triage
    escalate_to_human_agent(dept, reason=f"Low confidence ({conf:.2f})")
```

## Decision Primitives

| Primitive | Output | Use Cases |
|---|---|---|
| **`choice`** | Top label, probabilities per option, confidence | Department routing, intent classification, topic categorization |
| **`score`** | Expected level on ordinal rubric, distribution, confidence | Frustration level, ticket urgency, harm severity |
| **`noul`** | Calibrated probability $P(\text{true}) \in [0.0, 1.0]$ | Phishing detection, spam filtering, jailbreak detection, churn risk |
